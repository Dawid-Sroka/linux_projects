# Linux projects

In summer of 2023 I experimented with some Linux related topics. Mostly with
block devices, filesystems, partition tables and boot partitions.
In this repo I share my observations, as well as some of my programs.

## lsblk

While experimenting with partition tables I was using many different pendrives.
So obviously it was vary useful to quickly view all available block devices and their
parameters. The 'lsblk' tool is great for this. However I wanted to customize
it for my convenience.
